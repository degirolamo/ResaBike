So we are mainly talking about buses and other postal buses, especially in tourist areas! The idea being that it is more pleasant for everyone (operator, driver, traveler ...) to know how many cyclists wish to travel with their horses. This makes it possible to anticipate the best possible trailers to harness, or to announce to the travelers that the carrier is already well filled.","Send us a feedback":"Send us a feedback"}
